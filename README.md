# `docker-show-context`

Ever wonder why docker pauses when you do `docker build`, and what you can do
about it? You know, when it says `Sending build context to Docker daemon`?

This program shows where time and bytes are spent when building a docker context.

It is based directly on the same logic that Docker itself uses to build the
context.

## Getting started (docker):

```sh
docker build -t docker-show-context https://github.com/pwaller/docker-show-context.git
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data docker-show-context
```

## Getting started (binaries):

Binaries are available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/pwaller/docker-show-context/releases).
Just grab the binary and put it in your path, then invoke it as
`docker-show-context`. Use at your own risk.

## Getting started (building from source):

You will need go 1.11 or more recent, which can be obtained from
[the go website](https://golang.org/dl).

Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/pwaller/docker-show-context
cd docker-show-context
GO111MODULE=on go install -v
```

# What the output looks like

The output looks something like this. It's easy to see now that I accidentally
included some large binary content (`*.deb` and `*.pdf` files in particular),
so I can now go and add those to my `.dockerignore` or delete them.

```
$ cd ~/path/to/project/using/docker
$ docker-show-context
Scanning local directory (in tar / on disk):
  24 / 1057 (62 / 216 MiB) (0.0s elapsed) .. completed

Excluded by .dockerignore: 1033 files totalling 153.98 MiB

Final .tar:
  24 files totalling 61.83 MiB (+ 0.02 MiB tar overhead)
  Took 0.04 seconds to build

```

# Notes about the current behaviour

This documents the current behaviour, which may not be ideal, but it is what it
is for now. Pull requests welcome.

* The amounts shown don't show recursive usage, they just show a single level
  of the directory. (Otherwise, the root would always be the biggest thing).

* Time records the amount of time between `tarFile.Next()` calls. I assume that
  this approximates the amount of time `docker/pkg/archive` spent constructing
  one tar entry. It might not be precise.

* "Total content" shows the uncompressed bytes inside files inside the tar.
  The total amount sent to the docker daemon is this amount plus the tar
  overhead.

* At this moment, only running with the build context root as the current
  working directory is supported, with a dockerfile named `Dockerfile`.
  Pull requests welcome to add parameters, so long as the existing default
  behaviour is preserved.

# How can I use this to make building faster?

Frequently, I find that `docker build` suddenly takes longer than I expect. It
is often the case that I have accidentally included some binaries or something
which I did not intend to include. This the purpose of this tool is to give
visibility into this, taking into account your existing `.dockerignore`,
so that you can improve your `.dockerfile` or delete assets you don't need.

It scratches an itch.
